# autonomous_vehicle_project
This is a project that me and two friends picked up in university.

This is a vehicle that uses OpenCV and a camera for vision and it's goal is to stay inside a track. While it was very challenging it was \
really fun to work on. Far from perfect but it's something that me and my teammates are proud of.

Planning a redux that uses ROS for better control and performace.
